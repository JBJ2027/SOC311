Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw (1995, p. 146) outline the six questions that ethnographers use to uncover information about processes and mechanisms:

What are people doing? What are they trying to accomplish?
How exactly do they do this? What specific means or strategies do they use?
How do members talk about, characterize, and understand what is going on?
What assumptions are they making?
What do I see going on here? What did I learn from these notes?
Why did I include them?
